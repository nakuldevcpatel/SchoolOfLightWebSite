    "**Question 1**: Describe the task that you specified in `task.py`.  How did you design the reward function?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: The task that I specified is to teach the quadcopter how to soar. The initial z position (the height) is 10, and the quadcopter can fly as high as possible within given run time (runtime = 5 in this case) but should be at least higher than the initial z position. The reward function defined in get_reward function is equal to the self.sim.v[2] which is the velocity on the z axis and apply np.tanh to it so that the reward values are bounded within (-1, 1). In this way when the velocity along z axis is positive (meaning flying higher) agent gets positive reward while if the velocity is negative (meaning flying down) the agent gets punished with negative reward. And the reward valuse are bounded within (-1, 1) to avoid too much variance of the total rewards. This is a quite effective reward function for this soaring task per my project.\n",

    "Reward function pentalizied the agent for positions far from target posion.Use only Z position. And normalize the error using tanh function between -1 and 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In my current implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "And after the first review I got following comments:\n",
    "\"What is the reason of ignoring velocity and euler angles? Have you tried adding velocity and/or angles to reward function?\"\n",
    "So, I changed my reward function, and the new reward function is now only using velocity on z-axis and limiting it to (-1, 1) using tanh function as suggested in troubleshooting section. It was very good suggestion and it really helped agent to learn and soar high up.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I also experimented with multiple reward equations to see how different parameters of enviornment affect the learning of the agent. Task.py has a reward function -  and I have tried multiple reward equations."

Then I spent more time to change in reward function, go through the slack channel to get more idea about it. I've commented code in reward function that outlines different experiments I did over the time to get the reward function right. And after first review, I got really good suggestions from reviewer - that helped me to modify my reward function and get the agent learn.\n",

Another Aha moment was at episode 945, when agent started showing positive rewards. I could visualize the rewards and target pos of the quadcopter and see it now soaring high with positive rewards till the end of 1500 episodes."
