          <p>Talent provides a formidable edge to every organization in the competitive landscape. Talent mapping begins at being able to understand the external environment, nature and history of a company, its contributing subsystems and their interlinkages, to gain an insight into constitution of manpower required. It also calls for the deep understanding of the business and job roles within them, to channel manpower availability dynamics into acceptable fulfillment solutions especially for critical talent segments.</p>

          <p>Policies, Procedures and systems enable the efficient functioning of the organization whilst ensuring it is in compliance with the law of the land. An ongoing challenge when designing and implementing policies and procedures for the Indian environment is to stay within the framework of all applicable, archaic we may add, labor laws while catering to novel business needs and a demanding breed of employees. The market practice for each tier of organization also needs to considered to ensure that the company stays at best appealing and at least comparable in the job market. A healthy functional ecosystem goes a long way in building a strong lasting culture anchored to the values of the organization.</p>
