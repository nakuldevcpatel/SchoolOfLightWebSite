          <p>Contrary to common way of implementing, the primary objective of TNA or competency mapping is to get the direction of capability efforts correct. So viewed, the exercise becomes a lot more about company’s general direction, strategy and hence the skills and competencies that such a path necessitates. A sense of coherence with the organizational objectives as well as an accounting for skill availability in the market resulting into a skill blue print may be considered mark of a good TNA exercise.</p>

          <p>The estimate of reaching a destination cannot be made without knowing where one currently is. Used as part of a whole, assessments are a great way of arriving at the current or as-is for any soft skill building initiative. What’s more, there is a wide choice of credible assessment tools available to suit every need. Only a ‘Before’ picture can tell if the ‘After’ was indeed an improvement!</p>

          <p>Soft skills are important part of ‘work readiness’. The idea is to bring greater awareness of self and greater enthusiasm to deploy the whole self at work. The pressure of being fun as well as impactful makes many training sessions neither. The effort of connecting a happy game/ touchy story to work is exasperating for most trainers especially if they have no organizational context.<br>With our expertise in ‘Theatre based training’ combined with our experience of being on the inside of the organization managing HR, we are able to help organizations choose their training objectives mindfully as well as deliver on those.</p>

          <p>Successful stories of change are essentially stories of appropriate and consistent support leading to will and win. The mental and behavioral transition of key people if left to chance, is equivalent to the success of the organization being left to chance. Coaching and mentoring programs are an excellent way to ensuring that desired behavioral changes occur in the key incumbents as a result of self awareness, realization and motivation. A sense of duty, however true, cannot not be mistaken for competence.</p>
