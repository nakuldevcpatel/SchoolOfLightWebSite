E Learning<br>

While the importance of a personal touch in learning cannot be undermined, technology aided learning gives organizations the choice of reach, standardization and cost effectiveness while allowing learners  flexibility in schedule, place and pace. Not to mention it makes pooling all learning resources incredibly easier than traditional training methods.<br>

The advent of social media as well as smart devices have made people highly comfortable with technology aided interaction. Combining that with exciting new methods such as ‘Game based’ sessions, E learning can deliver unmatched benefits to both organizations as well as learners.</p>

          <p>The future of managing employees is ‘Participative HR’. Opinion polls are the most direct and reliable way of understanding if an organization is offering apples for oranges. And if yes, then defining oranges better as well as redirecting the resources available, towards oranges than apples!<br>

          Choice of anonymity as well as the flexibility of place and pace while responding to an opinion poll could well be the difference between candid and engineered feedback. Technology aided surveys can garner honest responses and rapid analysis supported actions.  That’s is the most authentic way of building trust within an organization.</p>
